🚀 **Summary of Changes**: I've rolled out some cool new additions, tweaks, and cleanups! Here's the scoop on what matters most for you as a developer working with this project.

First off, we're shining in documentation territory – two brand spanking new files are here to make life easier: `.editorconfig` sits alongside some helpful `README.md`, and they bring structure right into your coding groove! Plus, there’s now a *security policy* (think armor for our codes) as well as the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct in SECUTIRY.md – think safety first!

In terms of changes, I've rejigged parts to make sure everything stays tip-top and tidy:
* Fixed string lengths were tightened up (in `gradle_install.py`), while the build configurations got a cleanup in `.kts` files – no more clutter!
* The Gradle magic is now sprinkled throughout with new docs for it, keeping things smooth as you jump between projects and languages; remember to keep those .NET bling badges front-and-center. 🎖️
* `README.md` got a facelift too – more visuals like pretty git statuses or roadmap links that make navigating my project not just easy, but fun!
* I also made sure to include the latest build info and security standards in our docs (think of it as being updated with new armor for your code). 🛡️
* Continuous grooming of Gradle installer is on-going – that's my jam. It’ll keep getting better over time! Just like a good relationship, right? Keeping things in check regularly (like removing `build.*` files) ensures everything stays slick and efficient as code evolves.
* And because I love tinkering even when life gets busy – especially during holidays with friends doing their own coding DoB style! – there's always some Gradle work ongoing for that extra edge in our installation wizardry (not to mention a fresh Plugi initiative). So stay tuned; it’s bound to be worthwhile. 🎢
* Last but not least, I made sure the project badges are all up-to-date and easily visible – because who doesn't like some shiny bling? It helps us identify our latest tools (like npm or .NET) at a glance!

I’m always working on ways to make this more delightful for you. Whether it means adding new features, improving the setup process, or enhancing collaboration and security – I've got your back as we build great software together. Keep coding awesome! 😎✨
