### TLDR Section

🚀 **NEW File/Dir**s made it even better for us developers, so here's the scoop on what got shuffled around:
- Added a `.editorconfig` file in multiple directories. This helps maintain consistent coding styles across different parts of our project (a big shoutout to consistency! 🎉). Plus, there’s an updated security policy and supported versions document for us to keep everything secure on the go ([SECUTIRY.md](security-policy) & [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](code-of-conduct)).
- A fresh `README.md` badge roadmap has been added, so we can always see where our journey's headed at a glance! 🛣️

On the flip side of things:
- **CHANGED FILE/Dir** updates mean I’m keeping up with releases on GitHub and Vim.org (no more delays for me, phew). And who doesn't love cleaning duplicates? The `.kts` file is now as tidy as a developer caffeine kick can make it!
- A bit of Gradle chaos turned into opportunity - I’m trying to get this bad boy rolling and ignoring build artifacts, because less clutter means more clarity. And heck yes, the `.NET` related stuff is now in its own bubble with a dedicated package manager (cooler shades for us dev-heads!).
- The `README.md`, oh my goodness... so much badging action just added and rearranged to make our lives easier - plus an HTML title tag, because why not mix things up? 😄 Now we can see project highlights even before diving into the code! Lastly, I'm tackling Gradle with my friends DoB (18.12 & 22.12), and plugi is in sight but on a bit of a rollercoaster ride – fingers crossed for speedy progress without compromising quality or fun times together at the coffee machine!
