## Status
Want to see status of plugin at any day? [Thats file for u](STATUS.md)


## Introduction
Have you ever found yourself adding multiple dependencies to your code before installing them? Do you hate switching between your editor and terminal for installing libs? ðŸ¤”

LazyDevHelper solves this problem! It's a Neovim plugin that lets you manage Python dependencies directly from your editor, eliminating the need to switch to the terminal.
And plugin have Discord channel [from now](https://discord.gg/QnthFV3Zgp)


## Plugin History
# ðŸ“ƒ Hitory of plugin creation
It was a deep night, *2:40 AM*, un-sleep me, phone, Notes, and brain (maybe it exist for me), and i one moment through "What if I will write the plugin for Neovim that installing libs right from editor, and will add this libs to requirements file" (generally, i through add only the Python-pip3 packages, but.. you see what happend)
And, because of that idea - i fully (at all, fck it) knocked down my sleep-mode during 4 months, and only now i have +- good sleep mode, so i can say only two things -
1. Do not deep into your project too deep - **you will fuck your organism, and will life in Light sleep phase, instead of REM + Deep sleep**

2. `If u wanna think up some project from nothing` - **just try to do not anything 1-2 days in coding, and brain from lazzy state will think up project itself**


## Features
âœ¨ Install Python packages directly from Neovim.  
âœ¨ Manage dependencies without leaving your editor.  
âœ¨ Compatible with modern Neovim configurations.  

## Future Features
(As of 20.10.25 8:14 PM its list clear, i`ll do just small fixes, maybe)

(1:01, 21.10.2024) - will be added installing libs right from requirements.txt for python, or from Cargo.toml ([Dependencies] block on corresponding file)


## Roadmap
Check my [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for upcoming features! Want to help? - contributions are welcome.
