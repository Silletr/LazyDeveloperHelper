**📃 Hitory of plugin creation**
It was a deep night, *2:40 AM*, un-sleep me, phone, Notes, and brain (maybe it exist for me), and i one moment through "What if I will write the plugin for NeoVim that installing libs right from editor, and will add this libs to requirements file" (generally, i through add only the Python-pip3 packages, but.. you see what happend)
And, because of that idea - i fully (at all, fck it) knocked down my sleep-mode during 4 months, and only now i have +- good sleep mode, so i can say only two things -
1. Do not deep into your project too deep - **you will fuck your organism, and will life in Light sleep phase, instead of REM + Deep sleep**

2. `If u wanna think up some project from nothing` - **just try to do not anything 1-2 days in coding, and brain from lazy state will think up project itself**
